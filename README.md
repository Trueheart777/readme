### About Me 🚀

 <p align="justify">
Hello, I am an Expert-Vetted, Software Engineer specialization in Conversational AI. 
I have expertise with chatbot frameworks, like  Conversational AI RASA, Amazon Alexa, Engati, Twilio, Dialog360, CHATFUEL, Many chat, Landbot.io, chatbot.com, Wati.io and many others.
I have helped companies integrate chatbots with systems already in place for 5+ years. 
First I do the integration accordingly for the use case using Python & Flask then help the technical team with the solution.

🚀Chatbot:
 I can develop chatbots for multiple communication channels such as websites, social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram), messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram), SMS, and voice bots. 
 I am well-versed in leveraging Webhooks for seamless integration with existing systems.
 I have successfully developed and deployed chatbots across various industries, including airlines, Real Estate, healthcare, dental services, events management, E-commerce and recruitment agencies. 
 My experience encompasses web chatbots, WhatsApp chatbots, Facebook chatbots, Telegram bots, voice bots, and SMS chatbots.
    🤩Why Chatbot:
    I Strongly believe, that a chatbot can be a virtual assistant of any business because chatbot can be available 24/7 which will increase customer satisfaction and engagement with your business. 
    It means more data will be generated we can use the data for analysis, visualization and API's.
🚀LLM:
 I have been developing applications with OPENAI and Google PALM for the past few months. 
 Especially for Extractive/Generative Question & Answering systems for unstructured text data like pdf. docx, website, JSON, google sheet etc.
 I can create a custom chatbot based on that data without much training needed.

🏅Experiences:
✔️Big Data & ML,<br>
By leveraging Apache Spark, I preprocessed the given data, performed the necessary cleaning and feature extraction, and chose the most suitable AI model for the task at hand. 
The distributed nature of Apache Spark allows for efficient processing of large datasets, making it a popular choice for big data analytics and machine learning tasks.
✔️Resource-prelimited Chatbot<br>
I developed various integrated ChatGPT projects such as "Proprietary AI" to assist customers with proprietary information(feeding from PDF, XLSX).
Main issue was to build a resourece-predefined Chatbot which answer the info only related to this company.
I've tried prompting and extracting specified data from PDFs, documents, but it was difficult.
After then, I found that solution.
That was great!
✔️AI Crypto Trading<br>
I have some experience with Trading automation using AI.
In the previous work, I worked on the AI-based Go lang project for the trading.
My client gave me a great review.
✔️Image detection<br>
In my previous work, we built a Alcohol-detection system for bad drive.
That project included,  Raspberry Pi hardware (alcohol detection using Q-Alcohol smart sensor, drive sleepy-detection using CCD camera ) and detection software to analysis the data using AI. 
That is utilizing broadly to avoid the traffic troubles.
During that project, there were so many difficulties but we struggled into success.
That was perfect.
My role was to integrate the hardware and software(in particular, AI software image detection and processing using TensorFlow).
✔️Own Model<br>
-Input Sanitization
-Syntax Validation
-Query Parameterization
-Domain-Specific Validation
-NLP library:
NLTK 
spaCy
-Frame works:
TensorFlow or PyTorch
✔️Data extraction<br>
I was in a data engineer's project.
I have used TensorFlow, padas, numpy, pysimplegui, aqdefreader, and docx python libraries.
Especially, I have analized the qdas files content and ouputed the report for the specific information by using TensorFlow.
It included excel, pdf and doc files with the specific table and graph.
As well as the workflow automatino perfectly completed!
Interpreting the given QDAS file, extraction and statistics from scratch was too difficult, but I did it successfully.  
I can analize all the data including QDAS files by using them.<br>

Feel free to contact me if you need any help.
